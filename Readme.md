# Machine Learning Models on Iris Dataset

This repository contains Python code for performing various machine learning models on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, containing measurements of iris flowers along with their corresponding species. The goal is to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features.
Dataset Description

### The Iris dataset consists of four features:
A. Sepal length
B. Sepal width
C. Petal length
D. Petal width

### There are three species of iris flowers in the dataset:
1. Setosa
2. Versicolor
3. Virginica

### Repository Structure
1. data/: Directory containing the Iris dataset in CSV format.
2. Logistic_regression/: Jupyter notebooks for exploring the dataset, performing data preprocessing, and building machine learning models.
3. README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

### Available Models
The following machine learning models are implemented in this project:
* LogisticRegression
* DecisionTreeClassifier
* RandomForestClassifier
* GradientBoostingClassifier
* AdaBoostClassifier
* VotingClassifier
* BaggingClassifier
